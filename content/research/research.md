<h1>Methodological Research </h1>

<!---
As the biological sciences advance, so too does the need for new statistical methodologies serving these advances. Above all, I believe that newly developed biostatistical methods should be both useful to scenarios realistically seen in biomedical research and comprehensible, if not usable, by non-statistical investigators. Broadly, my research interests are the construction of study designs that optimize efficiency while maintaining valid inference. My current projects pertain to developing theory necessary to utilize group sequential study designs in novel settings, and studying how such designs behave in settings where traditional assumptions may be broken and where limited resources and/or time horizons necessitate the use of such efficient design methodology.

A guiding tenant of my research philosophy is that newly developed biostatistical methods should be both useful in scenarios realistically seen in biomedical research and comprehensible, if not usable, by non-statistical investigators. My main research focuses on the development and application of statistical methodology for cluster randomized and pragmatic clinical trials with correlated data. These projects have largely been informed by specific biomedical collaborations I have worked closely in.

<h2>Pragmatic and Cluster Randomized Trials</h2>
Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are studies where treatment is randomized at the cluster level but outcomes are typically collected at the individual level. These designs are chosen for a variety of reasons such as the natural occurrence or grouping of the treatment clusters, treatment contamination prevention, or logistical constraints that would make individual randomization infeasible. This branch of trials can also include pragmatic modifications such as stepped-wedge CRTs (SW-CRTs), which progressively transition clusters from the control to the intervention condition and the transition timing is randomized for each cluster.

- **Optimal cluster randomized designs**: When CRTs are employed in pragmatic settings where identification of heterogeneous subpopulations is an important objective, diverse population characteristics may be key effect modifiers driving the variations in patient’s response to interventions, leading to what are known as heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Both outcome and covariate intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) play key roles in the variance of the HTE parameter estimate and thus sample size calculations. There is substantial uncertainty around outcome- and covariate-ICCs at the design stage, creating a notable obstacle in correctly powering CRTs for pre-specified HTE analyses. To address these complications, I derived new closed-form design formulas to determine the locally optimal cluster size and number of clusters for estimating the HTE parameter. I also developed a maximin design procedure for assessing the HTE, as well as a maximin design procedure which takes into account both the HTE and average treatment effect study objectives. (*Ryan et al., In Revision*)

- **Stepped-Wedge trials with time-to-event endpoints**: While methods for determining study power have been developed for SW-CRTs with continuous, binary or count outcomes, limited methods for determining study power are available for stepped wedge designs with censored time-to-event outcome. To bridge this gap, I developed a stratified Cox model-based framework to account for confounding by time in SW-CRTs, including development analytical power calculation methods and explicit robust sandwich variance formula to facilitate design calculations without the need for computationally intensive simulations. (*Ryan et al., In Preparation*)

<h2>Correlated Data and Group Sequential Designs</h2>

- **Clustered kappa statistic**: (*[Ryan et al., 2019 Stat Med](https://maryryan.netlify.app/publication/ryan-spotnitz-gillen-2020/)*) (*Ryan & Gillen, In Preparation*)

- **Group sequential observational studies**: (*[Ryan & Gillen, 2022 AoAS](https://maryryan.netlify.app/publication/ryan-gillen-aoas-2022/)*)

<h1>Collaborative Research</h1>

I believe that work done in collaborations should help to inform novel methodological research, and that methodological research should circle back to inform and shape collaborative work. Good collaborative statisticians are not just tools to be used in service of subject matter experts but full and equal members of the investigative research team - quantifying the limitations of what the data and methodology can tell us, identifying opportunities to go beyond the initial research goals, and effectively communicating those points to the rest of the team to shape the end research product.

I have been a member of the Gillen/Grill Alzheimer’s Disease Research Lab since 2017, where I have both led and provided statistical support for multiple projects, presented research at international AD conferences, and written first-author manuscripts for AD journals. The majority of my collaborative research in the lab has centered around the role of study partners in prodromal and preclinical AD trials.
