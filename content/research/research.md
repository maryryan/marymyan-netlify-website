<h1>Statistics Methodology Research </h1>

As the biological sciences advance, so too does the need for new statistical methodologies serving these advances. Above all, I believe that newly developed biostatistical methods should be both useful to scenarios realistically seen in biomedical research and comprehensible, if not usable, by non-statistical investigators. Broadly, my research interests are the construction of study designs that optimize efficiency while maintaining valid inference. My current projects pertain to developing theory necessary to utilize group sequential study designs in novel settings, and studying how such designs behave in settings where traditional assumptions may be broken and where limited resources and/or time horizons necessitate the use of such efficient design methodology. 

<h1>Applied Research</h1>

I believe that work done in collaborations should help to inform novel methodological research, and that methodological research should circle back to inform and shape collaborative work. Good collaborative statisticians are not just tools to be used in service of subject matter experts but full and equal members of the investigative research team - quantifying the limitations of what the data and methodology can tell us, identifying opportunities to go beyond the initial research goals, and effectively communicating those points to the rest of the team to shape the end research product.

I have been a member of the Gillen/Grill Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Lab since 2017, transitioning from a neuroscience novice to an adept AD authority, spearheading projects, presenting research at international AD conferences, and writing first-author manuscripts for AD journals. The majority of my collaborative research in the lab has centered around the role of study partners in prodromal and preclinical AD trials.
