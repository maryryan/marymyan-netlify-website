abstract: The two-stage preference design (TSPD) enables inference for treatment efficacy while allowing for incorporation of patient preference to treatment. It can provide unbiased estimates for selection and preference effects, where a selection effect occurs when patients who prefer one treatment respond differently than those who prefer another, and a preference effect is the difference in response caused by an interaction between the patient's preference and the actual treatment they receive. One potential barrier to adopting TSPD in practice, however, is the relatively large sample size required to estimate selection and preference effects with sufficient power. To address this concern, we propose a group sequential two-stage preference design (GS-TSPD), which combines TSPD with sequential monitoring for early stopping. In the GS-TSPD, pre-planned sequential monitoring allows investigators to conduct repeated hypothesis tests on accumulated data prior to full enrollment to assess study eligibility for early trial termination without inflating type I error rates. Thus, the procedure allows investigators to terminate the study when there is sufficient evidence of treatment, selection, or preference effects during an interim analysis, thereby reducing the design resource in expectation. To formalize such a procedure, we verify the independent increments assumption for testing the selection and preference effects and apply group sequential stopping boundaries from the approximate sequential density functions. Simulations are then conducted to investigate the operating characteristics of our proposed GS-TSPD compared to the traditional TSPD. We demonstrate the applicability of the design using a study of Hepatitis C treatment modality.
