abstract: Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials screen cognitively unimpaired older adults for biomarker criteria and disclose their results. We examined whether participants in the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease Study with “elevated” and “not elevated” amyloid differed in scores on the “Views and Perceptions of Amyloid Imaging” questionnaire. We hypothesized that, prior to disclosure, those with elevated amyloid would score higher than those with not elevated amyloid. We also quantified how responses changed after result disclosure. We assessed data from 4327 individuals who completed the questionnaire at screening visit 1 and after amyloid disclosure. We used linear regression models to assess the relationship between questionnaire category scores and amyloid status. We also quantified the relationship between category score changes and amyloid status.Overall, participants scored altruism and contribution to research as the strongest motivations for undergoing amyloid imaging. Those with elevated amyloid scored 0.23 points higher in the Perceived Risk category, on average, than those who had not elevated amyloid prior to disclosure; this effect attenuated towards zero after adjusting for Cognitive Function Instrument score. After disclosure, participants with elevated amyloid demonstrated less within-subject change in Perceived Risk, on average, compared to those with similar pre-disclosure scores who had not elevated amyloid, while demonstrating greater changes in the altruism and planning categories. Altruism and learning disease risk motivated enrollment in this preclinical AD trial. Participants with elevated amyloid differed from their not elevated counterparts in their perceptions of amyloid imaging, even before undergoing the procedure.
